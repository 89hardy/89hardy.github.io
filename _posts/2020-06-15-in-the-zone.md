After all these years, and a month after starting writing code again, I got a feeling that I was in the zone today. It sounds like a weird term, but no, I was. I started my day by working on something related to a Django tutorial. Then I moved to resolve the SSL issue on this webpage, which I could after some help from a dear friend. I then moved to set up Ubuntu subsystem on Windows and using that instead of Windows Cmd for command-line work. I again had to install ruby, gems, GCC, Make, Jekyll, and set up Git on the new subsystem. Even got to resolve my first ```git merge``` conflict after so long. Who could have thought that I would enjoy doing this!

The constant context switching, and the way I handled it, really made me feel that I was 'in the zone'. It's also good to see how my actual personality has started reflecting in the kind of developer I have become. I used to get frustrated and annoyed at every error as a 21 yr old, but it's very different now. I take a step back, think about all the possible reasons behind an error in a certain order, read up about it, try fixing it, and then eventually fix it. There's some mechanism which keeps me at ease and helps me tackle a problem in a structured way. While the problems that I'm solving right now are not extremely challenging, I still hope that I'm able to retain this attitude towards problem-solving when it comes to that.
